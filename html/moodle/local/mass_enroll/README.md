moodle_local_mass_enroll
========================

A Moodle 2.x tool for all teachers to enrol/unenrol existing users to their courses using CSV files (without bothering their admins)

Main features are :

* users can be specified by username, id number or email 
* users can be optionally enroled to groups/groupings (autocreated if needed)
* email reports can be send
* import can be repeated if some users are to be in several groups
* usage can be restricted by modifying specific capabilities (local/mass_enroll:enrol and local:/mass_enroll:unenrol) 
* can be inserted in Course's admin menu

This plugin has been tested from Moodle 2.7 onwards and is a continuation of 
Patrick Pollet's initial work.

See the wiki page https://github.com/rogiervandongen/moodle-local_mass_enroll/wiki for installation and usage. 

IMPORTANT MESSAGE:
Out of respect for Patrick and his family, and out of common courtesy, I have
removed Patrick Pollet's personal contact information from the source code, since
Patrick passed away on the 26th of January, 2015.
The initial copyright has been left intact, and was added to all source files 
where it wasn't present.
I, and many Moodle users with me, have been greatful for his work on this plugin
and I'm happy to continue his excellent work where Patrick unfortunately couldn't.
Patrick's original work should still be available on github:
